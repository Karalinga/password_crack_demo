# password_crack_demo
A virtual environment to test post request password cracking and brute forcing.
Just link your own sql database (or just store the data differently), link your email in 2fa.php to get the 2 factor authentication code and away you go. Just a basic testing environment to demonstrate and test how password brute forcing or word list attacks could occur (and how to develop counter measures).
